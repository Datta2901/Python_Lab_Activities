    "6. Modify the provided ReverseHelloMultithreaded file so that it creates a thread (let's call it Thread 1). Thread 1 creates another thread (Thread 2); Thread 2 creates Thread 3; and so on, up to Thread 50. Each thread should print \"Hello from Thread <num>!\", but you should structure your program such that the threads print their greetings in reverse order. When complete, ReverseHelloTest should run successfully. It's critical to note, though, that passing the test isn't sufficient for succeeding at this problem. You could pass the test just by writing code with a loop to count down. You've got to do this correctly via threading "

    "7. In computing, the producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue.\n",
    "The producer’s job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.\n",
    "At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time.\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "To make sure that the producer won’t try to add data into the buffer if it’s full and that the consumer won’t try to remove data from an empty buffer.\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "The producer is to either go to sleep or discard data if the buffer is full. The next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it notifies the producer, who starts to fill the buffer again. In the same way, the consumer can go to sleep if it finds the buffer to be empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer."

There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.\n",

Mutex is used such that no two philosophers may access the pickup or putdown at the same time. The array is used to control the behavior of each philosopher.
